# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Ether

Introduction

> Ether is an OpenAI toolkit that aims to give users the power to configure their OpenAI experience in Discord.&#x20;

> Ether is amnesiac and does not collect or redistribute any user data other than its designated API calls between Discord and OpenAI. Coupled with robust security in the Google Cloud, Ether provides extreme performance, reliability, freedom, and security to members sessions.

Ether is a toolkit and does not provide access to any integrated OpenAI API keys. Users must provide their own OpenAI keys to use in Ether.

### All OpenAI options and models in a single session

> Ether works by initializing the user into a looped class instance with their own Discord listener and optional configurations or optional API call structures. All features, such as DALL E, or GPT Visual are just an attachment or keyword away from being accessed.&#x20;

### Sharing sessions

> Session authors can share access to their session. All session variables are shared, including the role and prompt. Users may have multiple individual and unique sessions in a single channel, or many users can have access to a single session that is being shared.

### Powerful embeddings

> Ether's engine for processing and embedding data into ChatGPT is consistently ahead of the competition. Ether's engine for embedding data is very unique, custom built from the ground up and refined multiple times. Ether can embed data very quickly and supports a range of file types with new file types being added regularly.

### Have ChatGPT how you need it

> Ether aims to always provide all of the possible API options and model options to the user. Coupled with chat bot configurations, users can create a session that is totally unique to them and their desired experience. Easily save and load your favorite sessions, or use one of the newly generated profiles.

### Amnesiac approach & local variables

> Ether uses an amnesiac approach in session handling, configurations, and data. Users can save their configurations and associations to file for later use which are sent to the user in direct message. Data given to Ether for embeddings is discarded after being embedded, and when a session is closed all variables are destroyed.&#x20;

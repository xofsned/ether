# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sharing Sessions

***

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">Only one shared session per channel globally</mark>

This is enforced to mitigate multiple bot responses resulting from multiple shared sessions

<mark style="color:yellow;">Session resolving logic</mark>

Members who do not have an active session in the shared session channel will be resolved to the shared session in the channel. Users with their own session in a shared session channel are resolved to their own session
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Leaving shared sessions unattended can generate risks for account and usage abuse by other members.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
